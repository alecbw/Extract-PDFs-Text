# Extract-PDFs-Text

A neat little wrapper over [pdfplumber](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber) to extract text from 1 or more pdfs and write the text to .txts or a combined .csv

Will also detect the language of each PDF

## Usage

```py
python3 extract_text.py -file filename.pdf -output "txt"
```
